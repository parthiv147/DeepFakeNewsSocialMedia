Social media spreads news fast, but BOTs can post fake tweets. This study tests FASTTEXT, TFIDF, and TF with ML models like Na√Øve Bayes, CNN, LSTM, and Random Forest. CNN with FASTTEXT gives the best accuracy using the TweepFake dataset from Kaggle. Evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score, it helps detect fake tweets effectively.
